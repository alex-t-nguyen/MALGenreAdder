# MAL Genre Adder & Searcher
MAL (MyAnimeList) is the world's most active online anime and manga community and database. It is an anime and manga social networking and social cataloging application website. This program allows for users to search through their list and compile all their "Plan to watch" shows with a specific genre into a list, which will be displayed in Notepad.

## Usage
The program makes use of the "Tag" section (right hand side of list) of each anime in a user's list by automatically labeling the tags of each anime with their respective genres. By doing so, the program is then able to sort through all of the shows in the user's "Plan to watch" list and retrieve specific animes by genre.
